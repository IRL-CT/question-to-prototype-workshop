Workshop Description
Open to researchers, students, and practitioners at all levels — no prior design or robotics experience required.
Join us for an intensive 2-day workshop on integrating design perspectives into HCI/HRI research. This workshop focuses on design as a tool for inquiry — how to structure studies, build prototypes, and ask the right questions to understand what users truly need.
Participants will get hands-on experience building a robot and customizing it to their own research question. You'll learn to establish and run a design-forward lab, develop research questions through prototyping, and create purpose-driven interactive systems. The workshop emphasizes that users are experts in their own lives; our role as researchers is to design the right inquiries and tools to reveal insights about human needs and behaviors.
Workshop Structure
Day 1 Morning: Foundations & Lab Practice (with Prof. Wendy Ju)
