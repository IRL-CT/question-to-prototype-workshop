## About

Open to researchers, students, and practitioners at all levels -- no prior design or robotics experience required.

This workshop focuses on design as a tool for inquiry: how to structure studies, build prototypes, and ask the right questions to understand what users truly need. Participants will get hands-on experience building a robot and customizing it to explore their own research question.

The workshop emphasizes that users are experts in their own lives; our role as researchers is to design the right inquiries and tools to reveal insights about human needs and behaviors.

## Schedule

### Day 1 Morning: Foundations & Lab Practice
*With Prof. Wendy Ju*

- How to run a design-forward HCI/HRI lab
- Design theory and its applications in research
- The design process: asking the right questions
- Users as experts: designing studies that reveal true needs
- Sustainable and purposeful lab practices

### Day 1 Afternoon: Problem Exploration

- Identify a research question or human problem
- Build a robot using the [TinyBot kit](tinybot/)
- Design a robot or interface to explore your question
- Develop purpose-driven prototypes as research tools

### Day 2 Morning: Refinement & Presentation

- Finalize designs and prototypes
- Present research questions and proposed approaches
