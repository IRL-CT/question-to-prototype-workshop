# TinyBot: Building Instructions

Welcome to the TinyBot building instructions! Follow these guides in order to set up, build, and interact with your robot.

| Step | Guide | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [Preparation](01_prep.md) | Install software and set up your environment |
| 2 | [Software Setup](02_software.md) | Configure and upload code to the microcontroller |
| 3 | [Hardware Assembly](03_hardware.md) | Build your robot (driving or tilty mode) |
| 4 | [Interaction Design](04_interaction.md) | Design and prototype a human-robot interaction |

## What You'll Build

TinyBot is a small robot controlled via smartphone over a local WiFi network, using a TinyPICO microcontroller and Dynamixel motors. It has three control modes:

- **Drive mode** — A small driving mobile robot
- **Tilty mode** — A dashboard robot that can turn and look around
- **2-motor mode** — Direct control of each motor's position (0-360 degrees), useful for designing your own robot

## What You'll Need

- Laptop (Mac: macOS Sonoma or later)
- Smartphone (iPhone: iOS 17.3.1 or later; must be a personal device)
- TinyPICO microcontroller
- 2x Dynamixel motors
- Robot kit parts (provided at the workshop)
- Bluetooth speaker (for audio features)
