# Step 4: Interaction Design

Now that your robot is built, it's time to design an interaction around it. This is the core of the workshop: using your prototype as a tool to explore a research question about human needs and behaviors.

## Overview

- [A. Plan the interaction](#a-plan-the-interaction)
- [B. Act it out (without the robot)](#b-act-it-out-without-the-robot)
- [C. Design the robot's appearance](#c-design-the-robots-appearance)
- [D. Control the device (Wizard of Oz)](#d-control-the-device)
- [E. Record the interaction](#e-record-the-interaction)

## A. Plan the Interaction

Think about the scenario in which your robot will be used:

1. **Setting:** Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a kitchen, an office, a hospital room) When is it happening?
2. **Players:** Who is involved? Who else is present? Consider all the people in the environment. (Reflect: many current interactive devices like voice assistants didn't account for roommates or children being present.)
3. **Activity:** What is happening between the actors?
4. **Goals:** What is each player trying to achieve? (e.g., getting help with a task, receiving a reminder)

**Write down your setting, players, activity, and goals.**

## B. Act It Out (Without the Robot)

Physically act out the interaction you planned. For now, just pretend the device is doing what you've scripted for it.

Reflect:
- Are there things that seemed better on paper than when acted out?
- Did new ideas come up from acting it out?

---

## C. Design the Robot's Appearance

Now consider what the device should look like. Think about:

- The environment: could the device overheat? Is water a danger?
- Does it need bright colors for visibility (e.g., in an emergency setting)?
- How does its appearance affect how people perceive and interact with it?

**Make sketches of what your device might look like.**

What concerns or opportunities are influencing your design?

## D. Control the Device

Set up the robot so that one person can remotely control it (Wizard of Oz style) while another person acts out the interaction with it.

Use the phone control interface to operate the robot in real time during the scenario.

## E. Record the Interaction

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**

This recording will be used in your presentation on Day 2.
